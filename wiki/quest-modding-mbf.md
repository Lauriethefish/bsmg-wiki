# Quest Modding using ModsBeforeFriday

To begin with, make sure that you have the latest version of (vanilla) Beat Saber on your Quest. MBF will automatically downgrade this version to the latest moddable version, if mods haven't yet been updated to work with the latest Beat Saber.

:::warning
#### Browser Support
MBF needs an up-to-date chromium browser to work, i.e. [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download?form=MA13FJ) (included with Windows), [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/what-you-make-of-it/), etc..
It **will not work** on Firefox or Safari!

You will be warned if your browser is out of date or incompatible. Use one of the links provided to download an up-to-date browser.
:::

To get started, head to the [ModsBeforeFriday website](https://lauriethefish.github.io/ModsBeforeFriday/) then:

1. Plug your Quest into your PC using USB cable. (you do not need a fancy cable; most cables should work, however be wary of phone charging cables as these may only be designed for charging.)
2. Click the `Connect to Quest` button. You will be presented with a dialog that looks like this:
![A table of devices with heading "lauriethefish.github.io wants to connect", containing one device labelled "Quest 2". There are two buttons: "Connect" and "Cancel"](/.assets/images/beginners-guide/mbfSelectDevice.png)
:::tip
This dialog might look a little bit different if you're using a different browser! Select your device and continue to the next step.
:::

3. Select your device, and click `Connect`, then wait a few seconds. Your screen should look like this:
![A page with title "Install Custom Songs". There is a button labelled "Mod the app"](/.assets/images/beginners-guide/mbfReadyToMod.png)

:::tip
If you don't already have the latest moddable version of Beat Saber installed, you will instead be prompted to downgrade Beat Saber. This happens automatically, just follow the guide as normal!
:::
4. Click "Mod the app" and wait until it finishes.
:::warning
Do not unplug your cable while the game is being modded!
:::
5. You're all done! You can now install custom songs inside the game using the SongDownloader mod, which is installed by default.

## Adding additional mods
MBF has a built-in mod browser that you can use to add additional mods. Simply select "Add mods" in the main menu and hit "Install" on any mods you want!
